	- Strategies for (distributed) software development teams using Git
	- Release management
	- Hooks
	- Cherry-picking and bisectioning

### Day 2:
- Interfacing programming languages to each other
	- C vs. C++
	- Fortran vs. C (traditional fortran and modern fortran)
	- Python vs. C using Ctypes
	- Python vs. Fortran using f2py
	- Heterogenous parallel multi-language programming
	- Dynamic loading of compiled code via dlopen()

### Day 3:

	- OO program design: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Composition
	- Meta-programming
	- Domain specific languages, script language interfaces
	- Test driven development
	- Unit testing, regression testing, integration testing
	- Internal profiling, debugging

- Introduction to the team programming project
